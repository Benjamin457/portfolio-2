        I never had a background of coding before. At my school we never had coding subject or computer science.
    <br></br>
        I learn coding early this year at Codetelligent Bootcamp on February on the 14th, 2020.Thats when i was introduced to coding industry at Fountain of Hope in Khayelitsha.
        What i love about coding is that you can create Website, calculator, landing page etc.
